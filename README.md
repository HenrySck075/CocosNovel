# CocosNovel

Visual novel ~~engine~~ library for Cocos2dx 3.17.2 or smth


# Installation
nein

# Usage

## Scripting
the syntax is similar with ren'py, just with unreasonable syntax and no indentation, see [section nonexist](https://github.com/HenrySck075/CocosNovel/blob/main/Classes/utils.cpp#LL51C33-L51C33) for more detail

## Modifying UI
uhh either just
```
namespace CocosNovel {
    class NovelTextbox {
        ...
    }
}
```
or if you like me dont think it will work then modify the entire source code directly idk

# honorable mention
Test resources from DDLC (you know what i'll do when this is done)

hey guys it is me in the future

after remembering this i think it's better to just rewrite renpy in cpp instead of making this

so yeah uhh

# CocosNovel

The most (insert category here) in (where)

# Installation

# Using CocosNovel
## Scripting

The syntax is, uhh, similar to Ren'Py (if i didnt say that all complex syntax are literally renpy syntax)

# The fucking large TODO list (update over time)
- **Change the script to use C++ instead of Ren'Py-like script as i suck at making interpreter (idk how to do that)**
- Show statement
- take a nap
